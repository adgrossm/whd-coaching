       <p>My coaching methodology is a targeted, customized approach on performance improvement and leadership development.  Each coaching assignment requires a thoughtful approach during the engagement with the client in a process of self-discovery to realize that any personal or professional improvement needs to be self-directed and continuous. It is a supportive and non-judgmental process that challenges and stimulates critical thinking.  My role is to ask the right questions to encourage a deeper consideration of one’s options.  One needs to be able to see both the pieces and the whole to move forward in his or her professional development.
       </br>
        I have worked with senior executives to identify areas where there are opportunities to explore appropriate strategies and develop practical solutions to achieve improvement in their ability to deliver results.  Most professional development is accomplished through on-the-job leaning.  Though this is a critical source for employee development, it is limited by the experiences each individual is exposed to and the available solutions determined to be appropriate for a positive outcome.  In the absence of those experiences or the availability of a trusted mentor, most individuals have to blindly navigate difficult, high risk situations using their best judgement.  This approach is often less than successful in achieving the desired result.  I work with each individual to consider alternative options when confronting workplace challenges.  The process includes identifying areas that you should consider as opportunities for further development and we document an appropriate plan with specific steps to ensure an awareness of what needs to be done.  My clients have viewed me as a trusted advisor that avoids a cookie cutter approach.  My work identifies solutions to move performance to the next level.  Everyone is different and therefore what might work for one person is usually not the solution for another.  There is no one model or method that is followed, but rather a process using proven approaches, techniques and diagnostic tools to develop a plan. I embrace a straightforward style in working with his clients.  My experience working with senior executives puts me in a unique position to help you become more aware of your strengths and areas for development.
